    dvCommit SPECS, ASSUMING MULTIPLE PROJECTS PER USER:
    * confirm version number (a DecimalVersion) can be four digits, with 
        the last the so-called build number, which is zero by default
    * assume there is an append-only file in each top-level project 
        directory called buildLists
    * procedure:
        - get a lock on $PROJECT_NAME using xlattice.procLock
        - read version number N.N.N, read buildLists file to 
            determine its $BUILD_NUMBER N.N.N.B including build part
            * this determines the title of the buildList, which
            is $PROJECT_NAME  $BUILD_NUMBER where the B part is zero 
            unless there is an earlier commit for build N.N.N, in 
            which case B is one higher than the previous build number
        - read the RSA pivate key in PATH_TO_BL_KEYS/skPriv.pem
        - create buildList using the public key, signing it with 
            the private key
        - hash the buildList; this is its content key $HEX_KEY
        - insert the buildList into $DVCZ_UDIR using that
            content key
        - append "$TIMESTAMP $BUILD_NUMBER $HEX_KEY" to the
            buildLists file
        - unlock the project

    * dvczInit sets up individual user
        - writes keys to ~/.dvcz
    * bkp2uInit
        - writes bkp2u script, which invokes dvCommit
    * bkp2u 
        - -X uses .gitignore by default if present
        - writes buildList as PROJECT_DIR/.buildLists/CCYYMMDD-HHMMSS
